Alexis was expecting an important mail from her friend, Laura. She kept checking her inbox but she never saw any new message. When she eventually got to speak with Laura on the phone, she realised that she had sent the mail to her old email box, which was no longer in use. So, she (Alexis) never got it. Now, when God speaks to you, His Word is addressed to your spirit, not your brain or physical senses. If you try to understand it with your senses, you’ll never get the essence of the Word. God’s Word goes through your mind, which is the doorway to your spirit, but its actual destination is your spirit.

You’re not only flesh and blood; the real “you” is a spirit, and that’s the one to whom God’s Word is addressed. If the Word can get into your spirit, then it can affect your whole life positively. It can heal your body, too. Describing God’s Word, Proverbs 4:22 says, “For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.” The Hebrew word translated “health” is marpe, which means medicine. If you’d meditate on God’s Word consistently, it’ll work like medicine in your body.

This is why you must respond to the Word from your spirit. Your head can’t grasp the Word of God. The response from your spirit to the Word will eventually determine what you see in the physical realm.
